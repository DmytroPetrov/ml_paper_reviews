## Roles

- **Scientific Peer Reviewer**: The paper has not been published yet and is currently submitted to a top conference where you’ve been assigned as a peer reviewer. Complete a full review of the paper answering all prompts of the official review form of the top venue in this research area (e.g., NeurIPS for Deep Learning and ACM SIGGRAPH for Geometry & Animation). This includes recommending whether to accept or reject the paper.
- **Archaeologist**:  This paper was found buried under ground in the desert. You’re an archeologist who must determine where this paper sits in the context of previous and subsequent work. Find and report on one older paper cited within the current paper that substantially influenced the current paper and one newer paper that cites this current paper.
- **Hacker**: You’re a hacker who needs a demo of this paper ASAP. Implement a small part or simplified version of the paper on a small dataset or toy problem. Prepare to share the core code of the algorithm to the class and demo your implementation. Do not simply download and run an existing implementation – though you are welcome to use (and give credit to) an existing implementation for “backbone” code.
- **Practitioner**: You're trying to find a practical real-world application for the results of the research.
